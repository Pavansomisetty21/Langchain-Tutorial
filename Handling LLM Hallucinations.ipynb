      " The question \"Roger's 3 months old baby is learning artificial intelligence from since 5 years\" is a bit of a trick question. It plays on the idea that learning AI requires complex understanding and can only happen through formal education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how to break down the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **It's impossible for a 3-month-old baby to learn AI in the way we typically understand it.** Babies lack the cognitive development and language skills to grasp concepts like algorithms or neural networks.\n",
      "* **However, the statement is technically inaccurate because a baby cannot \"learn from since 5 years\" if they are only 3 months old.** The phrasing is nonsensical.\n",
      "* **We can interpret the statement as a humorous exaggeration.**  It suggests the baby is incredibly advanced, but it's clearly a playful way of saying the baby is exposed to technology from a very young age.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, the most accurate answer would be something like:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"That's a funny way to put it!  While a baby can't understand complex AI concepts, it's likely that Roger's baby is already interacting with technology in some form. Even simple AI-powered toys can introduce basic concepts of interaction and learning.\" \n",
