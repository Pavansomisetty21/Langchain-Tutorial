### Memory
Memory becomes very crucial when you wish to have a chatbot and when past conversations in the current session are important. This can be a useful module for help/support bots for many
websites. So let’s get started with integrating Memory into your LLM using LangChain. Do remember that if you use any LLM without explicitly integrating memory, it won’t be able to
remember past conversations as it happens in ChatGPT,GEMINI. Let’s get started with a basic memory integration.

### conversational buffer memory

In LangChain, conversational buffer memory is used to maintain the context of a conversation across multiple interactions, allowing for coherent and contextually aware dialogue. This is particularly useful when building chatbots or conversational agents where the conversation needs to flow naturally, with the system remembering previous exchanges.
1. Purpose:
Context Preservation: The primary purpose of conversational buffer memory is to maintain a coherent context throughout a conversation. It stores all the previous messages exchanged between the user and the model, allowing the model to reference past interactions when generating responses.
Seamless Dialogue: By retaining the entire conversation history, the model can produce responses that are contextually relevant, contributing to a more natural and engaging conversational experience.
 
 
 1. The prompt has a new variable called ‘chat_history’ which will help you store past
conversations apart from the human_input variable which we will use to provide the prompt.
 2. Next, we define a ConversationBufferMemory object to create a memory object. There exist
many different types of memories in LangChain. The variable ‘chat_history’ is passed to this
memory object.
 3. While creating the LLMChain object, pass a new parameter memory to enable memory for this
particular chain.
That’s it. Now if you carry on with the same chain object and ask it questions around the past
conversations, it would be able to answer as you can see in the above conversation where in the 3rd
question, the bot understood we are talking about Machine Learning taking reference from the past
conversation. Also, the whole conversation is visible in the logs.

### coversational Summary memory

Conversational Summary Memory in LangChain is an advanced memory mechanism that maintains the context of a conversation by summarizing previous interactions rather than storing the entire conversation history verbatim. This approach allows for more efficient context management, particularly in long conversations where maintaining a full history might be impractical due to token limits or performance concerns.

Overview of Conversational Summary Memory

#### Purpose:

Efficient Context Management: Instead of keeping a complete record of the conversation, summary memory generates a concise summary of past interactions, which the model can reference to maintain context.
Scalability: This method is useful for handling long conversations without overwhelming the model or exceeding token limits.
How Conversational Summary Memory Works

#### Initialization:

You initialize the ConversationSummaryMemory object, which will automatically summarize the conversation history as it progresses.

#### Conversation Flow:

As the conversation continues, the memory summarizes key points and interactions, updating the summary with each new exchange.
When generating responses, the model refers to this summary rather than the full conversation history.

#### Integration in LangChain:

The memory component is integrated into a language model chain (LLMChain), which handles the interaction between the model and the memory.
Considerations

#### Summary Accuracy: 

The quality of the summary can affect the model's ability to maintain context. Poorly summarized interactions might lead to less relevant responses.

#### Complexity vs. Simplicity:

While summary memory is more efficient, it might not capture every detail, which could be a limitation in conversations requiring high fidelity.


### When to Use Conversational Summary Memory

Long Conversations: Ideal for applications where the conversation is expected to be lengthy, and storing the full history isn't feasible.
Resource Constraints: Useful when operating within models with limited token capacity or in environments where performance is a priority.
Scenarios Requiring Conciseness: Effective in scenarios where only the key points of a conversation need to be retained.

### Conclusion

Conversational Summary Memory is a powerful tool in LangChain for maintaining conversational context efficiently. By summarizing interactions, it allows for scalable, contextually aware dialogue, even in lengthy conversations, making it an excellent choice for applications with high performance or token management needs.
